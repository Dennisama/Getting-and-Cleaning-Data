This file contains all the variables and summaries I calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:
1.Set your own work directory, then load the package dplyr, which is used for later data summarization.
2.Read "x_train.txt","y_train.txt","subject_train.txt","x_test.txt","y_test.txt","subject_test.txt", then assign them to corresponding 
variables.
3.Bind train and test data together, assign the result to following 3 variables, bind_data, bind_label and bind_subject.
4.Read "features.txt", then assign it on data_feature. 
5.Based on the written pattern of the mean and standard deviation, we search for corresponding indices on data_feature, then use indices 
to extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of each measurement. In accordance with descriptive variable names given 
by data_feature, rename the column names of bind_data, then remove the redundant parenthensis "()" included in the names.
6.Read "activity_label.txt", then use descriptive activity names to name the activity name in the data set, and rename the column names 
of activities, finally assign the result to renew bind_label.
7.Rename the column names of bind_subject, bind the updated bind_data, bind_label and bind_subject together, which is the clean data we 
are looking for. Write it out as "clean_data.txt" (10299 x 68) in current work directory, a 5.3 Mb text file, whose first column is Subject
is integer, second column Activity is factor, and the rest of columns are all numeric.
8.Set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, write it out as "mean_data.txt" (180 x 68) in current work directory, a 
0.1 Mb file, whose first column is Subject is integer, second column Activity is factor, and the rest of columns are all numeric.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
